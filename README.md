# Working_With_Data
Three Projects
1) Anomaly Detection Basics
    Used machine temperature data to make a modl and find the outliers using isolation forests
2) Machine Learning
    Used simple fake data to make a model to predict taste in music based on age and gender
3) Mapping Earthquakes
    Used data https://earthquakes.usgs.gov to map the magnitude of earthquakes over 30 days based on longitude and latitde
